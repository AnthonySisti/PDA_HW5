Fifth Assignment from Brown's Graduate level Practical Data Analysis Course, Fall 2019. Course Taught by Dr. Chis Schmid.

# Goal
The focus of this assignment is model building and selection. Students were asked to build a model to predict the glomelular filtration rate (GFR) from two kidney disease studies. Students wrote a bootstrap algorithm to adjust for optimism on training data in using forwardand backward stepwise regression to select a best model for predicting GFR. In addition, studens used cross-validation to construct a predictive model with a) stepwise regression; b) ridge regression; c) lasso regression. Performance was assesed for the different models in text, tables and figures discussing both the differences between the model findings and consistencies.

# Code
